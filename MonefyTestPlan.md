**Object of testing**: Monefy mobile application (Not subscribed to pro version of the app).

**App Version**: 1.9.19

**OS**: Android 10 or higher

**Devices**: Huawei Honor 8x

**Testing Objective**: 
Monefy is a money management tool which allows users to track their expenses and income. Considering the app has a pro version, the business goal is to sell it to the customer. This goal can be achieved if the primary functions of the app are working flawlessly and a customer has a positive user experience. 
So, our focus areas will be:
 - The application can be installed and updated without losing user data
 - Working of primary features: Adding money to total balance, Adding expenses, Checking calculations of total expenses and income for over a specific period, checking categories of expenses & income breakup
 - User doesn't have access to pro features
